REQUIRED SOFTWARE:
CPLEX
COIN-OSI

INSTALLATION STEPS:
1. Install CPLEX
2. Install COIN-OSI configuring it to use CPLEX (see https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure)
3. unzip the source code from the file "BCP-sched-MPC.zip"
4. Adjust the references to the CPLEX and the COIN-OSI in the Makefile (variables "CPXLDIR", "CPXIDIR", and "OSIDIR")
5. Execute the "make" command
6. unzip the instances from the instance files "Orlib_inst.zip", "Souayah_inst.zip" and "Tanaka_inst.zip"
7. Optionally run the heuristic to obtain an upper bound using the shell command "./SSTBH <instance filename> <number of machines> <instance number>"
8. Run the desired version of the Branch-Cut-and-Price using the shell command "./swtLP-<version suffix> <instance filename> <upper bound>" (the number of machines is obtained from the instance filename)
9. If the CPLEX Branch-and-cut can be used to finish the instance resolution, the CPLEX commands to do so will be printed by the solver in the standard error output

BRANCH-CUT-AND-PRICE VERSIONS:
swtLP-BCP: runs the complete BCP but also generates the lp file after the root node is finished to continue the instance resolution using the CPLEX Branch-and-cut.

swtLP-Root: runs only the BCP root node and generates the lp file to continue the instance resolution using the CPLEX Branch-and-cut.

swtLP-1LP-A: runs only the first LP of the BCP without variable fixing and without stabilization.

swtLP-1LP-B: runs only the first LP of the BCP without variable fixing.

swtLP-1LP-C: runs only the first LP of the BCP without stabilization.

swtLP-1LP-D: runs only the first LP of the BCP.
